Summary:


The spring-boot framework is used to build this application, and  we used Spring Security and JWT to get the  authentication and authorisation token.

we have make it last  longer  the duration of the refresh token  expiration and separate it from the access token.

instead of using access token as a refresh token we have created expiration for each access and refresh. that helps us to have different independent keys for both tokens.
